The feature that I will be implementing in my COMP 055 project will be adding a menu to select the player car.
The user will be shown images of cars and they can select that car image and play with that car.

Pseudocode:
Display a car selection menu with a pane:
	Allow user to click through the menu and select a car 
Once selected loads an image path file from a text file which is parsed
starts the game with image of the selected car

I have added the feature in this game for a player to select a car from a menu with easy GUI. Once the user selects the car they can go and play the game with their selected car. To make sure that this feature works a tester can launch the game and first click the Car Selection button. Afterwards they can click through and find a car that they like and select it. Afterwards they can play the game and see that the "player" car is the one that they chose.
