The feature that I will be implementing in my COMP 055 project will be adding a menu to select the player car.
The user will be shown images of cars and they can select that car image and play with that car.
Pseudocode:
Display a car selection menu with a pane:
	Allow user to click through the menu and select a car 
Once selected loads an image path file from a text file
starts the game with image of the selected car
